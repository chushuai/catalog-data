    "description": "The inaugural Cyber-security Research Ethics Dialogue & Strategy Workshop was held on May 23, 2013, in conjunction with the IEEE Security Privacy Symposium in San Francisco, California. CREDS embraced the theme of \"ethics-by-design\" in the context of cyber security research, and aimed to:  Educate participants about underlying ethics principles and applications;  Discuss ethical frameworks and how they are applied across the various stakeholders and respective communities who are involved;  Impart recommendations about how ethical frameworks can be used to inform policymakers in evaluating the ethical underpinning of critical policy decisions;  Explore cyber security research ethics techniques, tools, standards and practices so researchers can apply ethical principles within their research methodologies; and discuss specific case vignettes and explore the ethical implications of common research acts and omissions.",
