    "name": "First Amended Report of AT&T Independent Measurement Expert: Reporting requirements and measurement methods",
    "datePublished": "2016.06",
    "description": "In compliance with the merger Order between AT&T and DirecTV, AT&T has engaged CAIDA to serve as the Independent Measurement Expert (IME) as described in the Memorandum Opinion and Order (\u201dFCC Order\u201d), Appendix B, V: Internet Interconnection Disclosure Requirements. As described in this appendix, our task is to develop a proposed methodology for measurement and reporting of data, in the context of the following obligation imposed on AT&T.\r\n\r\nThe structure of this document is as follows. Section 2 specifies the disclosure exemption. Section 3 described the reporting requirements on interconnecting parties, connectivity and traffic management details. Sections 4 and 5 catalog the data that AT&T must collect, and methods to collect it. We distinguish the process of collection from the reporting that results from the measurements. Section 6 specifies the nature of the reporting.\r\n\r\nIn a separate filing, titled \u201cReport of AT&T Independent Measurement Expert: Background and supporting arguments for our analysis\u201d we provide our rationale for our data sharing requirements and specific measurement methodologies.",
    "annotation": "Acting as an independent contractor, CAIDA will conduct measurements and assessments of performance characteristics of traffic exchanged at AT&T Internet Interconnection Points located within the United States. ",
