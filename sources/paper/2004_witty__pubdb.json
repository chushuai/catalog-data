    "description": "On Friday, 19 March 2004, at approximately 8:45 p.m. Pacific Standard Time\r\n(PST), an Internet worm began to spread, targeting a buffer overflow\r\nvulnerability in several Internet Security Systems (ISS) products,\r\nincluding its RealSecure Network,\r\n\r\nRealSecure Server Sensor, RealSecure Desktop, and BlackICE. The worm took\r\nadvantage of a security flaw in these firewall applications that eEye\r\nDigital Security discovered earlier in March. Once the Witty worm--so\r\ncalled because its payload contained the phrase, \"(^.^) insert witty\r\nmessage here (^,^)\"--infects a computer, it deletes a randomly chosen\r\nsection of the hard drive, which, over time, renders the machine unusable.\r\n\r\nWhile the Witty worm is only the latest in a string of self-propagating\r\nremote exploits, it distinguishes itself through several interesting\r\nfeatures:\r\n\r\n* It was the first widely propagated Internet worm to carry a\r\ndestructive payload.\r\n* It started in an organized manner with an order of magnitude more\r\nground-zero hosts than any previous worm.\r\n* It represents the shortest known interval between vulnerability\r\ndisclosure and worm release--it began spreading the day after the ISS\r\nvulnerability was publicized.\r\n* It spread through a host population in which every compromised host\r\nwas proactive in securing its computers and networks.\r\n* It spread through a population almost an order of magnitude smaller\r\nthan that of previous worms, demonstrating worms' viability as an automated\r\nmechanism to rapidly compromise machines on the Internet, even in niches\r\nwithout a software monopoly.\r\n\r\nIn this article, we share a global view of the worm's spread, with\r\nparticular attention to these worrisome features.",
