    "description": "When monitoring network traffic, a flow measurement approach can provide the\nadvantage of data reduction in near real-time.  RTFM, the IETF's standard,\ngeneralised architecture for measuring traffic flows, and NeTraMet, an\nopen-source implementation of that architecture, are introduced.  The results\nof a NeTraMet usage survey are presented, together with a detailed description\nof the NeTraMet components and the ways they can be used to construct traffic\nflow measurement systems for any particular network.  Nifty, an X Window\nnear-real-time traffic flow analyser, is also described.  Experiences with\nNeTraMet are summarised, highlighting its usefulness in building customised\nflow measurement system.\n\n",
