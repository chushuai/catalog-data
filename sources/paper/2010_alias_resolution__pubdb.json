    "description": "The well-known traceroute probing method discovers links between interfaces on Internet routers. IP alias resolution, the process of identifying IP addresses belonging to the same router, is a critical step in producing Internet topology maps. We compare the performance and accuracy of known alias resolution techniques, propose some enhancements, and suggest a practical combination of techniques that can produce the most accurate and complete IP-to-router mapping at macroscopic scale.",
