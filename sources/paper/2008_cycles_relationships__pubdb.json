    "description": "Several users of our AS relationship inference data, released with cs/0604017, asked us why it contained AS relationship cycles, e.g., cases where AS A is a provider of AS B, B is a provider of C, and C is a provider of A, or other cycle types. Having been answering these questions in private communications, we have eventually decided to write down our answers here for future reference. \r\n",
