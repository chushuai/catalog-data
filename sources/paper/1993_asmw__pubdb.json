    "description": "The relative performance of different data collection methods\r\nin the assessment of various traffic parameters is significant when the\r\namount of data generated by a complete trace of a traffic interval is\r\ncomputationally overwhelming, and even capturing summary statistics for\r\nall traffic is impractical. This paper presents a study of the\r\nperformance of various methods of sampling in answering questions\r\nrelated to wide area network traffic characterization. Using a packet\r\ntrace from a network environment that aggregates traffic from a large\r\nnumber of sources, we simulate various sampling approaches, including\r\ntime-driven and event-driven methods, with both random and deterministic\r\nselection patterns, at a variety of granularities. Using several metrics\r\nwhich indicate the similarity between two distributions, we then compare\r\nthe sampled traces to the parent population. Our results revealed that\r\nthe time-triggered techniques did not perform as well as the\r\npacket-triggered ones. Furthermore, the performance differences within\r\neach class (packet-based or time-based techniques) are small.\r\n",
