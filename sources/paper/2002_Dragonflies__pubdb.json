    "description": "\nAbstract -- We present the concept of network traffic streams, and the\nways they aggregate into flows through Internet links. We describe a\nmethod of measuring the size and lifetime of Internet streams, and use this\nmethod to characterise traffic distributions at two different sites.\nWe find that although most streams (about 45% of them) are dragonflies,\nlasting less than 2 seconds, a significant number of streams have lifetimes\nof hours to days, and can carry a high proportion (50% to 60%) of the total\nbytes on a given link. We define tortoises as streams that last longer than\n15 minutes. We point out that streams can be classified not only by lifetime\n(dragonflies and tortoises) but also by size (mice and elephants), and note\nthat stream size and lifetime are independent dimensions.\nWe submit that Service Providers (ISPs) need to be aware of the distribution\nof Internet stream sizes, and the impact of the difference in behaviour\nbetween short and long streams. In particular any forwarding cache mechanisms\nin Internet routers must be able to cope with a high volume of short\nstreams. In addition ISPs should realise that Long-Running (LR) streams\ncan contribute a significant fraction of their packet and byte volumes --\nsomething they may not have allowed for when using traditional 'flat rate\nuser bandwidth consumption' approaches to provisioning and engineering.\n",
