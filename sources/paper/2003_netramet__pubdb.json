    "description": "\nThe purpose of this paper is to present an implementation\nof a method that combines active and passive methods to\nmeasure and estimate the main performance parameters in IP\nnetworks. More specifically the method integrates performance\nand flow measurements. The main features of the method and an\nimplementation using the flow meter NeTraMet are described.\nTest results for packet delays and delay variations, losses and\nthroughput are presented. Applications to monitoring of traffic\nfrom server-based networks and an adaptive monitoring system\nare also considered.\n",
