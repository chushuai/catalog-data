    "description": "This paper presents the results of a measurement study of the T1 NSFNET\r\nbackbone. We first discuss the measurement environment and approach to\r\ndata collection. We then present measurements results for: long-term\r\ngrowth in traffic volume, including attribution to domains and\r\nprotocols; trend in average packet size on the network, both over long\r\nand medium term intervals; most popular sources, destinations, and site\r\npairs; traffic locality; international distribution of traffic; mean\r\nutilization statistics, both of the overall backbone as well as of\r\nspecific links of interest; and delay statistics.\r\n\r\n",
