    "description": "Assessing QoE in situ is a challenging task. Researchers have employed crowdsourcing-based approaches to achieve scale and diversity of subjects, but not without confounding factors. Apart from subjective bias of users, environmental factors introduce variance to QoE measurements. We propose QUINCE, a QoE measurement platform, which uses a gamified approach to enable longitudinal study with repeated and varying measurements in a single platform. We leveraged existing Internet measurement data and infrastructures to integrate three different types of network and QoE measurements to yield a more comprehensive view of subjects. Our preliminarily results show that QUINCE achieves a high level of engagement from subjects and collects data that is useful for correlating network performance and YouTube video streaming QoE.",
