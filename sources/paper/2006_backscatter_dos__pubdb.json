    "description": "In this paper, we seek to address a simple question: \"How prevalent are denial-of-service attacks\r\nin the Internet?\" Our motivation is to quantitatively understand the nature of the current threat\r\nas well as to enable longer-term analyses of trends and recurring patterns of attacks. We present\r\na new technique, called \"backscatter analysis\", that provides a conservative estimate of worldwide\r\ndenial-of-service activity. We use this approach on 22 traces (each covering a week or more)\r\ngathered over three years from 2001 through 2004. Across this corpus we quantitatively assess\r\nthe number, duration and focus of attacks, and qualitatively characterize their behavior. In total,\r\nwe observed over 68,000 attacks directed at over 34,000 distinct victim IP addresses -- ranging\r\nfrom well-known e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Hotmail to small foreign ISPs and\r\ndial-up connections. We believe our technique is the rst to provide quantitative estimates of\r\nInternet-wide denial-of-service activity and that this paper describes the most comprehensive\r\npublic measurements of such activity to date.\r\n",
