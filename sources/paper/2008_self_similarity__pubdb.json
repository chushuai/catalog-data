    "description": "We demonstrate that the self-similarity of some scale-free networks with respect to a simple degree thresholding\r\nrenormalization scheme finds a natural interpretation in the assumption that network\r\nnodes exist in hidden metric spaces. Clustering, i.e., cycles of length three, plays a crucial role in this\r\nframework as a topological reflection of the triangle inequality in the hidden geometry. We prove that\r\na class of hidden variable models with underlying metric spaces are able to accurately reproduce the\r\nself-similarity properties that we measured in the real networks. Our findings indicate that hidden\r\ngeometries underlying these real networks are a plausible explanation for their observed topologies\r\nand, in particular, for their self-similarity with respect to the degree-based renormalization.\r\n\r\n",
