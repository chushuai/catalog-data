    "description": "\nWe present measurements of stream lifetimes in California and at Auckland.\nWe suggest that one could ignore streams with less than six packets,\nsince they usually account for 10% or less of the total bytes.\nHowever, we often observe large bursts of small 'attack' streams; we remark\nthat a strategy of `focusing on the elephants' can be upset by\nsuch 'attack' streams.\n",
