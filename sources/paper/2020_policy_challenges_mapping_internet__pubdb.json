    "description": "Interconnection links connecting broadband access providers with their peers, transit providers and major content providers, are a potential point of discriminatory treatment and impairment of user experience. However, adequate data to shed light on this situation is lacking, and different actors can put forward opportunistic interpretations of data to support their points of view. In this article, we introduce a topology-aware model of interconnection to elucidate our own beliefs about how to measure interconnection links of access providers and how policy- makers should interpret the results. We use six case studies that show how our conceptual model can guide a critical analysis of what is or should be measured and reported, and how to soundly interpret these measurements. ",
