    "description": "\r\nWe used time series analysis to create detailed forecasts of future NSFNET backbone traffic. The resulting ARIMA model made quite accurate forecasts of\r\ntraffic levels up to a year in advance. It appears that the model can make reasonable predictions for two or more years into the future, suggesting that ARIMA\r\nmodeling has great promise as a tool for long-range NSFNET forecasting and planning. \r\n\r\n",
